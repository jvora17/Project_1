During spring, "Bob" was helping farmers in the fields to make pickles with his team. .
A tool named Backhoe was used to dig a hole as a part of making the fence.
The tool was happy to help with the task.
Then "Scoop" said "what a beautiful spring day it is!".
After the task, they took a break
The game was "hide-and-seek".
